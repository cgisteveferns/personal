When you go to the RTO, take along with you:

Original DL along with 2 photocopies of the DL
Write an application to the RTO stating that your DL is showing de-duplication error and/or not appearing online and that you need it to be entered by them
The DL supervisor at the RTO will attend to it. He will check on the system and either de-duplicate by issuing a new DL number or do the data entry. Mine was resolved immediately.

Have it checked online by someone who has access to a computer or check on your phone, then and there, to ensure it is done and you donâ€™t need to make another trip
