Kubernetes

is an orchestration tool for deploying & manageing applications in the Docker Container
Advantages .
1. High Availability
2. scalabale
3. Restoration in case of failed A



1. Node - > Pod -> Container
Pod Can have many containers -> recomended is 1 container per pod 
Pod is an abstraction layer over container
Service is attached to a Pod , Service is has an ip address , So een if the Pod dies and gets recreated , it will have the same ipaddress through the pod
Service can be a external (public) service eg for UI , or a internal(private) service for DB Services or backend 
Ingress LB is used to communicate to the pods which can have a proper url like https://mydomain.com.
Deployments are used to create the stateless pods
Statefulset are used to create the stateless pods.
Any application config like properties are stored in configMap & secret credentials in secret map


Worker Nodes
3 process run on worker Nodes
1. Docker runtime
2. Kubelet
3 Kube proxy

Master Node
API Server  - entry point or gateeay to the cluster
Scheduler  - schedule pods for requests coming from Gateway
Controller Manager - Monitors/Manages  the state of the pod if a pod is not healthty requests Scheduler to schedule a pod
etcd : key value pair , maintains the state of cluster , resources available , 

Master Node is less resource intensive , While worker nodes are more resource intensive

Deployments
kubectl get pods -n gto
kubectl get services -n gto
kubectl get deployments -n gto
kubectl edit deployment deploymentname -n gto
